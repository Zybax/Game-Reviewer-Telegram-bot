# Setup

### 1. Create bot... 

This is the logic behind a telegram bot in order for it to work you should create a bot and add it to a chat group if you want

* You can follow the steps from here to create your "soulless" bot 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-telegram?view=azure-bot-service-4.0

* Once you finish that small process you should be in the possession of a token (your bot token)
also the BotFather should give you this address along with your token: "t.me/botname" 

* Click on it and start your bot.

Now you can talk to him! but remember he cant hear you...

2. ### Add the bot to a chat group (Optional)

* Just go to the chat group you want and add the bot as if it was a normal user (you should be admin of the group of course)

3. ### Connect the bot

* Awesome... now you just have to clone this repository and inside the repo's folfer you open your terminal and type:

`TOKEN=<YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE> node index.js` 

* Then try the /help command in the bot chat 


### Now you should be able to use the bot :)
